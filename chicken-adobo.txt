Ingredients:
 - 1 (3 1/2 pound) whole chicken
 - 12 whole cloves garlic
 - 1 cup apple cider vinegar
 - 1/2 cup soy sauce
 - 1 tablespoon coarsely ground black pepper
 - 4 dried bay leaves

Directions:
 1. Cut the chicken into 10 pieces: breasts, wings, thighs and legs, cutting the
    breast pieces in half. Place the chicken pieces into a large lidded Dutch
    oven or casserole. Add the garlic, vinegar, soy sauce, pepper and bay
    leaves.

 2. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce to
    medium-low, cover and simmer until the chicken is thoroughly cooked (the
    meat will be firm, the juices will run clear, and a thermometer inserted
    will read 165 degrees), about 25 minutes. Turn the chicken halfway through
    for even cooking.

 3. Remove the cooked chicken pieces from the sauce and set aside on a plate.
    Continue to cook the sauce until it's reduced to about 1 cup, about 10
    minutes.

 4. Strain the sauce, then add the chicken back to the sauce and toss to coat
    completely, before moving to a serving platter.
